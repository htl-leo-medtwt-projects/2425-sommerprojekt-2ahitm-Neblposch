    "Ah, you’re awake. Or at least... something resembling awake. Let’s call it progress."

    "You may find yourself confused, disoriented, possibly even questioning your life choices. Don’t worry — that’s normal here."

    "The red lighting? Yes, it's terribly dramatic, isn’t it? The decorators were going through a phase."

    "There’s a note on the table, left by someone who came before you. Spoiler alert: it didn’t end well for them."

    "Do take your time. Standing up, looking around, existential dread — all very valid responses."




    "Ah, lasers. Because nothing says ‘warm welcome’ quite like instant, searing death."

    "Now, you could attempt to dodge them. Show off your agility. Or, alternatively... you could press that large, friendly-looking switch behind you."

    "Two options lie before you: the direct route, favored by the brave — and the functional route, favored by those who enjoy living."

    "Yes, those beams are quite lethal. No, I didn’t install them. I simply enjoy watching people forget how switches work."

    "By all means, tiptoe between the lights like a ballerina in a minefield. I’ll be here... narrating your funeral."




    "Oh dear, not that one. Too far left. But don't worry — we're narrowing it down."

    "No, no, still not quite right. Perhaps a bit more... centered, this time?"

    "Bold. Incorrect, but bold. You're circling the truth now — I can feel it."

    "Just one left to try. Unless, of course, you're the type to repeat mistakes."     

    "Ah, splendid. The fourth — a number of quiet confidence. You chose... wisely, for once."


    "Ah, a room in shambles. It’s comforting, in a way — a kind of honest chaos."

    "That terminal on the wall? Yes, it’s expecting a number. Something meaningful. Something... final."

    "‘When did it all end?’ An excellent question. Philosophical, even. But in this case — literal."

    "There’s a newspaper in the corner. A relic from when headlines still mattered. Perhaps you’ll find the world’s obituary there."

    "Try not to think too hard. The date you're looking for is burned into history. Along with everything else."


    "Well that's not correct"
    "Far off"
    "Not even close"
    "Ahh, 20 77. The year everything really went up in smoke. So much for utopias. But don’t worry, I’m sure it was all worth it in the end... right?"








    "Ah, the elevator. The final escape. Or perhaps just another stop on the endless, pointless journey. But what do I know? I’m just here for the ride."

    "It’s odd, isn’t it? After everything, it comes down to this. A shiny, metallic box taking you to... somewhere else. Or perhaps, nowhere at all."

    "A new beginning? A fresh start? I can’t say. The forest is pretty, I’ll give you that. But it’s probably hiding something just as deadly."

    "And now, we travel. Upward? Downward? Forward? Who knows. The destination is always the same, no matter the path."

    "Enjoy the ride, my friend. You might just find peace... or a lovely view of what remains of humanity. Quite the choice."






"Well, here we are. The end of the line. A forest, untouched by... well, whatever happened before. How quaint. Maybe you’ll finally find the peace you were looking for... or maybe you’ll find that it’s just another part of the puzzle. Either way, I’ll leave you to it."
